    <h1>Work in Progress</h1>
    <p>Roc's initial release is still under development, and this website is a placeholder until that release is ready.
    </p>
    <p>In the meantime, if you'd like to learn more about Roc, here are some videos:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for link in links %}
        <li><a href={{link.url}}>{{link.name}}</a> - {{link.description}}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p>To set clear expectations around Roc's readiness for serious use - it's not ready yet! - the repository where
        it's
        developed is private for now.</p>
    <p>Anyone can get access to the repo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzWm_eoUXM&t=4353s">in this way</a>,
        or
        you can download a zip of <a href="roc-source-code.zip">the source code</a>, although the zip isn't updated very
        often and is
        definitely behind what's in the repo.</p>
    <p>Roc also compiles to WebAssembly and you can try it out on the web <a href="repl/">here</a> (remembering it's not
        ready yet!)</p>
